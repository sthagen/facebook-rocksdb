Change the default value for option `level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes` to true. This affects users who use leveled compaction and do not set this option explicitly. These users may see additional background compactions following DB open. These compactions help to shape the LSM according to `level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes` such that the size of each level Ln is approximately size of Ln-1 * `max_bytes_for_level_multiplier`. Turning on this option has other benefits too: see more detail in wiki: https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Leveled-Compaction#option-level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes-and-levels-target-size and in option comment in advanced_options.h (#11525).
