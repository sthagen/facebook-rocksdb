During off-peak hours defined by `daily_offpeak_time_utc`, the compaction picker will select a larger number of files for periodic compaction. This selection will include files that are projected to expire by the next off-peak start time, ensuring that these files are not chosen for periodic compaction outside of off-peak hours.
