HyperClockCache now has built-in protection against excessive CPU consumption under the extreme stress condition of no (or very few) evictable cache entries, which can slightly increase memory usage such conditions. New option `HyperClockCacheOptions::eviction_effort_cap` controls the space-time trade-off of the response. The default should be generally well-balanced, with no measurable affect on normal operation.
