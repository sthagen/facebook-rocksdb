Updating the tiered cache (cache allocated using NewTieredCache()) by calling SetCapacity() on it was not working properly. The initial creation would set the primary cache capacity to the combined primary and compressed secondary cache capacity. But SetCapacity() would just set the primary cache capacity. With this fix, the user always specifies the total budget and compressed secondary cache ratio on creation. Subsequently, SetCapacity() will distribute the new capacity across the two caches by the same ratio.
