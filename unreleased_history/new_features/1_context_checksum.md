* Added enhanced data integrity checking on SST files with new format_version=6. Performance impact is very small or negligible. Previously if SST data was misplaced or re-arranged by the storage layer, it could pass block checksum with higher than 1 in 4 billion probability. With format_version=6, block checksums depend on what file they are in and location within the file. This way, misplaced SST data is no more likely to pass checksum verification than randomly corrupted data. Also in format_version=6, SST footers are checksum-protected.
