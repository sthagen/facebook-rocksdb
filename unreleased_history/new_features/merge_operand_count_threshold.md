Added a new read option `merge_operand_count_threshold`. When the number of merge operands applied during a successful point lookup exceeds this threshold, the query will return a special OK status with a new subcode `kMergeOperandThresholdExceeded`. Applications might use this signal to take action to reduce the number of merge operands for the affected key(s), for example by running a compaction.
