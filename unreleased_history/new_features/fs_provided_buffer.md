Add FSReadRequest::fs_scratch which is a data buffer allocated and provided by underlying FileSystem to RocksDB during reads, when FS wants to provide its own buffer with data instead of using RocksDB provided FSReadRequest::scratch. This can help in cpu optimization by avoiding copy from file system's buffer to RocksDB buffer. More details on how to use/enable it in file_system.h. Right now its supported only for MultiReads(async + sync) with non direct io.
