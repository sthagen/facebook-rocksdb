Add an API NewTieredVolatileCache() in include/rocksdb/cache.h to allocate an instance of a block cache with a primary block cache tier and a compressed secondary cache tier. A cache of this type distributes memory reservations against the block cache, such as WriteBufferManager, table reader memory etc., proportionally across both the primary and compressed secondary cache.
