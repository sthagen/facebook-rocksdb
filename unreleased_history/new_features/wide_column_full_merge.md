Added a new wide-column aware full merge API called `FullMergeV3` to `MergeOperator`. `FullMergeV3` supports wide columns both as base value and merge result, which enables the application to perform more general transformations during merges. For backward compatibility, the default implementation implements the earlier logic of applying the merge operation to the default column of any wide-column entities. Specifically, if there is no base value or the base value is a plain key-value, the default implementation falls back to `FullMergeV2`. If the base value is a wide-column entity, the default implementation invokes `FullMergeV2` to perform the merge on the default column, and leaves any other columns unchanged.
